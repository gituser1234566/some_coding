This article delves into the intricacies of Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs)
in the context of construction prediction and classification. The primary
objective is look at the behavior of FFNNs, shedding light on their application
in construction-related tasks. The study closely examines the theoretical
underpinnings of FFNNs, focusing on fundamental components such as input
layers, hidden layers, and activation functions.
The study involves comparative simulations, with traditional methods like
linear regression for prediction and logistic regression for classification serving as
benchmarks. Through these simulations, the study explores how FFNNs operate
in these scenarios, comparing them to ordinary techniques. The emphasis lies
on understanding the unique patterns and complexities FFNNs can capture
within construction data, rather than merely benchmarking them against other
methods.
By studying FFNNs behavior through practical simulations, this study
provides  insights into their suitability for prediction
and classification tasks.
