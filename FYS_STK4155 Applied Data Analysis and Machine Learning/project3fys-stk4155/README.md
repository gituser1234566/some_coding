#  Classification with tree based methods:
This article presents a exploration of tree-based machine learning algorithms,
specifically focusing on Boosting, Random Forests, and Classification Boosting.
The discussion begins with a theoretical overview, offering a understanding of
the fundamental principles behind these algorithms.The exploration involves
practical application through simple simulation. This simulation serve as
a means to bridge theory and application, enabling readers to observe how
these algorithms perform for a classification task on "Chess (King-Rook vs.
King)" dataset from the USI dataset repository.FFNN will be used as a
benchmark to see how a none tree based method does compared tree methods
