#  Three fundamental regression techniques:
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. 

In the world of data analysis, the quest for accurate models is a continual
challenge. Central to this pursuit is the subtle balance between bias and
variance, a core concept in predictive modeling. In this article, we explore
this balance by examining three key regression techniques: Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Our goal extends
beyond theory; we aim to uncover practical insights, particularly within the
domain of geographical data analysis. Throughout this article, we investigating
how OLS, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression handle geographical data.
Through simulations, we explore the bias-variance trade-off and delve into the
differences between OLS, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression in general.To
enhance our understanding, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Our analysis of model complexity involves a detailed examination of OLS, Ridge,
and Lasso, shedding light on their fundamental differences.
