The following four jupyter files,show examples of federated learning on a classification problem and a prediction problem applied on a dataset that is a record of appliance energy consumption in one year from 50 households. The consumption is recorded every 15 minutes. Each household has the following 10 appliance
records: air conditioner (AC), dish washer, washing machine, dryer, water heater, TV,
microwave, kettle, lighting, and refrigerator.

We use an RNN and a LSTM as our two models of choice and compare how they do compared to each other bought on the training and test data.
