The following four jupyter files are evaluation of the provided microgrid system as part of
a mandatory assignment. Our approach involved employing deep reinforcement learning techniques within the Gym framework, utilizing a custom environment tailored to the Gym package. Prior to employing deep reinforcement learning through Stable Baselines 3, we created a bespoke environment using Gym. We applied the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm from Stable Baselines.

We use different numbers of households ranging from 25 to 250 and two different reward functions to see how the range of households and reward function influence the cost of the microgrid.
